# Vending Machine Challenge

Create a console program that imitate the Vending Machine, receives the standard input and generate the standard output.

## Business rules

    1. Valid coins are 10 JPY, 50 JPY, 100 JPY, 500 JPY. (Consider that others coins, paper money are not exist)
    2. Using 10 JPY and 100 JPY for change.
    3. Conditions to determine change possibility 
        Change is impossible if the coins contained in the Vending Machine’s vault is in the below conditions:
        - 10 JPY coin: Less than 9 coins
        - 100 JPY coin: Less than 4 coins
        In case if vending machine running out of 10 JPY coin, then 50 JPY, 100 JPY, 500 JPY coins cannot be used.
        In case if vending machine running out of 100 JPY coin, then 500 JPY coins cannot be used. 
    4. State of whether or not the items can be purchased is as following
        - Item is out of stock and Item price > Inserted amount -> Cannot purchase [Sold out]
        - Item is out of stock and Item price ≦ Inserted amount -> Cannot purchase [Sold out]
        - Item is in stock and Item price > Inserted amount -> Cannot purchase [Display nothing]
        - Item is in stock and Item price ≦ Inserted amount -> Can purchase [Can purchase]
    5. In case that there is any abnormal operation, then System does not response to this operation.
        For example: Return command before inserting coins, Purchase unavailable-for-purchase items, take out items from empty outlet, etc.
        (* As alternative solution for above situations, output exception message to console is OK)

## Use cases

- Start Vending Machine
Pre-conditions: None
Post-conditions: Vending Machine showing current state and in position to accept new inputs.

Scenario:
    1. The manager starts the Vending Machine
    2. System counts the money in vault and the goods in-stock.
System displays the state of the Vending Machine and turn into Input accept state.

- Purchase goods
Pre-conditions: Vending Machine showing current state and in position to accept new inputs.
Post-conditions: Vending Machine showing current state and in position to accept new inputs.

Scenario:
    1. Customer insert coins (standard input (Command (1))
    2. System stores the coins in provisional socket. System calculates the total inserted amount, and determines whether items can be sold. (State of Vending Machine is displayed, being in Input accept state.)
    3. Customers instruct System the items for purchase (Push the Purchase button) (Standard input (Command (2))
    4. System delivers specified items to the outlet. System deducts the amount of purchase from the total inserted amount.(State of Vending Machine is displayed, being in Input reception state.)
    5. Customer get items from the outlet (Standard input (Command (3))
    6. System empties the outlet. (State of Vending Machine is displayed, being in Input accept state.)
    7. Customers instruct system to return the change (Pull the return lever)  Standard input (Command (4))
    8. System stores the coins in provisional socket to the vault, and returns the change.(State of Vending Machine is displayed, being in Input accept state.)
    9. Customers get the coins from Return gate (Standard input (Command (5))
    10. System empties the Return gate.(State of Vending Machine is displayed, being in Input accept state.)

Alternatives:
e-2 In case if change is not possible, just return the insert coins as it is.
e-3 If the total inserted amount is not enough to purchase items, then return to [1] and perform coin inserting.
e-4 If unavailable-item is chosen for-purchase, then System do nothing.
e-5,7 In case of continuous purchase of items, return to Coin inserting [1] or Purchase item instruction [3].
e-1,3 If the purchase items process is interrupted(gave up), then go to Return command [7].
e-8 In case that no item is purchased then just return the coins in the provisional socket as it is.
